# AniNotes

**In the moment plugin isn't even really alpha, it works like shit and I know it. If you have any ideas or thoughts you want to share feel free to open issue or pr.**

*Plugin is heavily inspired by MyAnimeNotes plugin which was deleted by its author for unknown reasons.*

Basically what this plugin allows you to do is download all of your anilist anime and manga lists into obsidian notes which will have metadata from AL available for using in templates as well as your progress and notes on them.

Intended use is to take more complex notes on manga or anime and reference them in your own notes.
